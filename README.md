get, build, initialize and run [SAP Hybris Commerce Suite](https://www.hybris.com/en/commerce) inside [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container

**It's unofficial PoC for experimental purposes! It's not supported by SAP Hybris! Do NOT use it in production!**

Read [a blog post about dockerizing Hybris](http://wittchen.io/2016/07/27/dockerizing-hybris/).

**Please note**: Since version 6.3 Hybris has built-in recipes with Docker support and it's recommended solution. This repository contains only unofficial Proof of Concept with development setup.

Quick start
-----------

If you have already [installed Docker](#installing-docker) and Git, just open the terminal and do the following things:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/pwittchen/ydocker.git
cd ydocker/
./ydocker -b
```

Provide your credentials and wait while container is being created. It may take about 30 minutes or more.

When it's done, run the server with the following command:

```shell
./ydocker -r
```

Wait a while, let the server to start up and then check if everything works by visitng the following URL:

```
https://localhost:9002/backoffice
```

That's it!

Usage
-----

If you haven't installed Docker yet, go to the section about [installing Docker](#installing-docker) first.

You can use helper shell script called `ydocker` with the following parameters:

```
-b    building Docker container
-r    running Hybris Server in Docker container
-c    running Docker container with CLI
-i    showing info about Docker container
-u    showing Commerce Suite Download Url
-d    deleting Docker container
-h    showing help
```

Inside `.ydocker.conf` file you can view or customize the following parameters:
- Docker image name
- Commerce Suite version (set `latest` to keep your software fresh - you can also set specific version like `6.2`; in the latest releases versioning style was changed, so `latest` may not refer to the latest version - it's recommended to specify the concrete version - e.g. `18.08`)
- Artifact type (`snapshot` or `release`)
- Recipe
- Host port
- Container port

Please remember that you need to have your own SAP e-mail and password
in order to be able to download SAP Hybris Commerce Suite from Hybris repository inside Docker container.

Installing Docker
-----------------

If you haven't installed Docker yet, follow instructions below.

### Ubuntu

If you are using Ubuntu Linux and want to install Docker, follow official instructions for [Installation on Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntulinux/) from the Docker website.

### macOS

If you are using macOS and want to install Docker, get [**Docker for Mac**](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/) from the official Docker website.

Resolving problems with Docker
------------------------------

When you get the following message: `cannot connect to docker daemon`:
- Make sure that Docker daemon is running by typing: `sudo service docker status`
- If Docker daemon is stopped, type: `sudo service docker start`
- Type `sudo` before **every** Docker command (works on Ubuntu Linux)

When you get the following message: `port is already allocated`:
- Restart Docker daemon by typing: `sudo service docker restart` and run container again (works on Ubuntu Linux)

Server endpoints
----------------
- Hybris Administration Console (HAC): `https://localhost:9002/`
- Backoffice: `https://localhost:9002/backoffice`
- B2C accelerator: `https://localhost:9002/yacceleratorstorefront/en/?site=apparel-uk&clear=true`

Platform build version
----------------------

To get information about build and version of the platform inside created container, use the following commands:

```
./ydocker -c
cat /home/sap-hybris-commerce-suite/hybris/bin/platform/build.number
```

Remarks
-------

This repository does not contain any source code or libraries of SAP Hybris Commerce Suite.
It just downloads them, if you provide valid credentials to the shell script.
You should have such credentials if you're company employee or partner.
You'll need a lot of space on disk (probably about 12 GB, but I think 15 GB is safe number), because Commerce Suite is huge project. Size of built container is 6.8 GB.
Moreover, **it's not official company's repository**.
It's just proof of concept and may be not fully functional and stable.

Testing
-------

This solution was tested on the following systems:
- Ubuntu Linux 14.04 LTS
- OS X El Capitan 10.11.6

Building container and running the application went fine. Docker was installed according to the official instructions.
